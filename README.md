White Wine Classification Project for EE8603

Abstract:

   In this white wine quality classification project, the goal was to leverage machine learning techniques to predict and categorize the quality of white wines based on various chemical attributes. A dataset containing numerical features such as 'fixed acidity,' 'volatile acidity,' 'citric acid,' and more, was utilized for model training. The target variable, initially represented as a numerical wine quality score, was appropriately converted into categorical classes to align with the classification task. The PyCaret machine learning library was employed for streamlined model selection, evaluation, and deployment. After comparing several classification models, the Random Forest Classifier emerged as the best-performing model with an accuracy of 66.66%, demonstrating a solid balance between precision and recall. The model's area under the curve (AUC) was 0.3417, indicating reasonable discrimination power. The efficiency of the Random Forest model was underscored by a relatively low training time of 0.68 seconds. Overall, the project successfully utilized machine learning to classify white wine quality, with the Random Forest model exhibiting promising performance in the task.
