Abstract:

   In this white wine quality classification project, the goal was to leverage machine learning techniques to predict and categorize the quality of white wines based on various chemical attributes. A dataset containing numerical features such as 'fixed acidity,' 'volatile acidity,' 'citric acid,' and more, was utilized for model training. The target variable, initially represented as a numerical wine quality score, was appropriately converted into categorical datatypes to align with the classification task. The PyCaret machine learning library was employed for streamlined model selection, evaluation, and deployment. After comparing several classification models, the Random Forest Classifier emerged as the best-performing model with an accuracy of 66.66%, while also demonstrating a solid balance between precision and recall at 67.41 & 66.66% respectively. The model's area under the curve (AUC) was 0.3417, indicating a reasonably poor ability to distinguish between wine classes. The efficiency of the Random Forest model was underscored by a relatively low training time of 0.8770 seconds. Overall, the project successfully utilized machine learning to classify white wine quality, with the Random Forest model exhibiting promising performance in the task.
